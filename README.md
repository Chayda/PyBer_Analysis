# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Pyber Analysis 
### The purpose of this analysis is to analyse the ride-sharing data from January 2019 to end-of-April 2019. We will use a summary DataFrame of this data by city type to determine how the data is different per city type and use this information to provide suggestions to the decision-makers at PyBer.

## Pyber Analysis Summary:
### Recommendations based on analysis.

1) Collect information on the average distance travelled per ride by city type. Charge more per distance (km) for rides in urban cities, as there appears to be higher demand  due to population density and the likelihood that these trips are typically shorter.
2) Incentives to get more drivers to the rural areas, which may help lower the average fare rates.
3) Car pool options for riders in rural areas, which would incentivize people to use the service while lowering the rates they pay. The driver can drive less km, making more fares.
